				\begin{block}{Overall Functioning}
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Tracker's activity can be organized in four phases: 
						\begin{itemize}
							\item the initialization of the tracking method,
							\item the monitoring
							\item the collection of dirty page addresses
							\item the exploitation of the latter (e.g., for checkpointing)
						\end{itemize}

							\item \texttt{/proc}, which is the default solution implemented in both CRIU and Boehm, incurs an overhead of up to 102\% with CRIU on the Phoenix \texttt{pca} application, and up to 232\% with Boehm on the Phoenix \texttt{string-match} application.
							\item The overhead of SPML is up to 114\% with CRIU and 273\% with Boehm on the same applications.
							\item EPML leads to the lowest overhead, which is about 7\% with CRIU and 24\% with Boehm.
